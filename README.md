3. Viewing the Docx File


1. To install the Program 
   - You will want to first download the zip file provided.
   - Next you will see an executable file. 
   - It is recommended you create a new folder on your device and copy and paste the .exe file into is, as your saved docx files will be s
     saved here later on.
   - Double click or select the .exe file to run it.
   - It may take a few seconds to let it load up.
   - All done! you're ready to go.

2. Using the Program
   - You will see two entry boxes. Here you will want to copy and paste in two different amino acid chains
   - Please ensure there are no symbols, numbers, or empty entry's otherwise you will get a warning of an invalid submission.
   - You may select between a "manual" or "default" name. This is to name your output file. You can have a manually generated name, or you can create one yourself.
   - Once both entries are filled, you may press the compare button. You will get a prompt letting you know the compare is complete.
   - The Docx file will be saved to the same location the .exe file is in.
   - Once saved, the submission boxes will automatically clear so you may submit again if you would like or close the program.

3. Viewing the Docx File
   - Open the .docx file that you have previouly saved.
   - You will see the first protein sequence that you entered and it's molecular weight. Then you will see the second sequence, or your "comparison sequence" and it's molecular weight.
   - Next you will see a table. This table is read by each row. So for each row it will first go by the similarity found in Sequence one, and it's location will be given by the starting index to it's ending index. Next the column will be for Sequence 2. This will show the similarity or identical sequence and it's starting and ending location in Sequence 2.
   - The very rightmost column is labelled "exact match". If the sequence is similar but NOT identical, this will be labelled with a 1. If the sequence is similar but  NOT identical, this will be labelled with a 0.
   - Finally at the bottom the similar and identical sequences will be shown highlighted. Similar will be highlighted in pink, identical in turquoise. This fucntionality isn't very user friendly but was left as an optional way to view for the user. The highlighting is not in sequencial order and would need to be further developed.
